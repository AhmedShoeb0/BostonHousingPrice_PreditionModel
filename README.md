About project:
-
- The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe a house in Boston, our machine learning model must predict the house price. 
- To train our machine learning model with boston housing data, we will be using boston dataset. 
- We will be using **Random Forest Regression algorithm** for creating the prediction model. 

Dataset Attributes:
-
The Project includes 2 datasets (training dataset and testing dataset).
In each one of these datasets, each row describes a boston town or suburb. There are 14 attributes (features) with a target column (MEDV/Price) in the training dataset.

Attributes  | Details
------------- | -------------
ID | ID for each row
CRIM | per capita crime rate by town
ZN | proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft
INDUS | proportion of non-retail business acres per town
CHAS | Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; else 0)
NOX | nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
RM | average number of rooms per dwelling
AGE | proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
DIS | weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
RAD | index of accessibility to radial highways
TAX | full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
PTRATIO | pupil-teacher ratio by town
BLACK | 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
LSTAT | % lower status of the population
MEDV | Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000â€™s (the target)
